*SECURE FILE SHARING*

*1. Project Objective*:
 The Secure File Sharing project aims to design and implement a robust system for securely sharing files across networks, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data. The system will provide end-to-end encryption, access control mechanisms, and auditing features to protect sensitive information during transmission and storage.

*2. Problem Statement*:
 In an era of increasing cyber threats and data breaches, traditional file-sharing solutions often lack the necessary security measures to prevent unauthorized access, interception, and tampering. There is a need for a solution that guarantees data security while offering a user-friendly and reliable platform for exchanging files, particularly in sensitive industries such as finance, healthcare, legal, and research.

*3. Key Features*:
 End-to-End Encryption (AES-256, RSA)

 User Authentication and Authorization (MFA, RBAC)

 Secure File Transfer Protocols (HTTPS, SFTP)

 Integrity Verification (Digital Signatures, Hashing)

 Time-Limited Access and Expiry Control

 Audit Logs and Activity Monitoring

 Secure File Storage (Encrypted at Rest)

 Revocation Mechanism for Access Control

*4. System Architecture*
 Client Interface (Web/Desktop/Mobile): For uploading, downloading, and managing files securely.

 Backend API Server: Manages authentication, encryption/decryption, and access control.

 Encrypted Storage: Files are stored encrypted and decrypted only upon authorized request.

 Database: Stores metadata such as user information, file information, and permissions.

 Security Layers: TLS for secure transmission, AES-256 for file encryption, RSA for key exchange.

*5. Target Users*
 Corporate Teams: For internal reports and sensitive data sharing.

 Legal Professionals: For exchanging confidential documents.

 Healthcare Providers: For sharing medical records securely.

 Government Agencies: For handling classified information.

 Individual Users: For protecting personal data during sharing.

*6. Benefits*
 Privacy Protection: Ensures only intended recipients can access files.

 Data Integrity: Files remain unchanged during transit and storage.

 Ease of Use: Simplified interface for non-technical users.

 Compliance: Meets standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, or ISO 27001.

 Scalability: Supports growing user base and file volume
